# to-do

- [ ] Migrate to another image getter API (Pixabay, Pexels API)
- [ ] Liking hashtags as well
- [ ] Edit image with text (python libraries)
- [ ] Make Edit photo better (shadow, distort)

- [ ] Clean up code and make functions
- [ ] Loop is inefficient (change to start from end and keep last success on json file)
