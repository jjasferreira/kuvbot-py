Kuv is a Twitter bot written in Python 3.10.5 that scrapes images from across the web using the [Requests](https://github.com/psf/requests) HTTP library, edits them using [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow), the Python Imaging Library fork, credits them to their author, tries to tag them with a word using A.I. techniques and give it a corresponding confidence percentage, and finally tweets them using [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy).
It is currently using the [Unsplash](https://github.com/unsplash) API for image requests,the [Imagga](https://github.com/imagga) API for image recognition and the [Twitter](https://github.com/twitter) API for programmatic access to Twitter in advanced ways.
